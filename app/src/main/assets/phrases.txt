in an abandoned mine
the doors are locked
you come home late
my favorite places
take nice photograph
boys deserve fudge
play much better now
my fingers are cold
fire blazed all day
while you are ahead
i will meet you soon
subdivisions are bad
delivery is so fast
i like classic music
reading week is here
yes you are so smart
our life expectancy
old times were hard
where did you get it
communicate via mail
