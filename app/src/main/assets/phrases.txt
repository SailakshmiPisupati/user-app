rent is paid already
beginning of the day
jumping out of water
first time he tries
beautiful paintings
exchange with a bill
do not feel it bad
stock exchange fell
injustice occurred
news is to be late
meet in the lavatory
toss the ball around
wrong with his style
staying up all night
borrower or lender
problem with engine
walk before you run
traveling needs fuel
you visit a doctor
the beautiful sunset
did you talk to me
feeling exasperation
way to heat a house
the fire is raging
for an entire month
that is problematic
the system is broken
prayer offends some
the living is easy
my preferred treat
a tumor is provided
find a parking spot
redouble our efforts
wishful idea is fine
facts get in the way
apple from all tree
watch is expensive
everybody in battles
my favorite browser
be home before night
